We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
-----------------------------------------

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
    Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
-----------------------------------------
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<blockquote>
<canvas>
<dd>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>
<fieldset>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<form>
<h1>-<h6>
<header>
<hr>
<li>
<main>
<nav>
<noscript>
<ol>
<p>
<pre>
<section>
<table>
<tfoot>
<ul>
<video>



An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
Here are the inline elements in HTML:
<a>
<abbr>
<acronym>
<b>
<bdo>
<big>
<br>
<button>
<cite>
<code>
<dfn>
<em>
<i>
<img>
<input>
<kbd>
<label>
<map>
<object>
<output>
<q>
<samp>
<script>
<select>
<small>
<span>
<strong>
<sub>
<sup>
<textarea>
<time>
<tt>
<var>

What is XHTML?

    XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
    XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
    XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
    XHTML is supported by all major browsers
-----------------------------------------
Why XHTML?

XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.

If you want to study XML, please read our XML Tutorial.

The Most Important Differences from HTML

    <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
    The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
    <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
    Elements must always be properly nested
    Elements must always be closed
    Elements must always be in lowercase
    Attribute names must always be in lowercase
    Attribute values must always be quoted
    Attribute minimization is forbidden

Notes on GET:

    Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
    NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
    The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
    Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
    GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

    Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
    POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
    Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
